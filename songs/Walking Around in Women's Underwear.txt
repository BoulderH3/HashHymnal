Lacey things, the wife is missing.
Didn't ask for her permission.
I'm wearing her clothes,
Her silk panty hose.
Walking around in women's underwear.

In the store, there's a teddy,
With little straps, like spaghetti.
It holds me so tight,
Like handcuffs at night.
Walking around in women's underwear

In the office there's a guy named Melvin.
He pretends that I am Murphy Brown.
He'll say "Are you ready?" I'll say, "Whoah man!
"Wait until the wife is out of town."

Later on, if you wanna,
We can dress like Madonna.
Put on some eye shade, and join the parade.
Walking around in women's underwear.
