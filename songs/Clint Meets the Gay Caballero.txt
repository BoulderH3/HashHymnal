Oh, Clint was a cowboy, he rode on the range.
When he rode into town, he would sing this refrain:
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
I'll gladly pay Tuesday for a blowjob today.

On Clint, at the whorehouse, the doors were slammed shut,
His credit no good for a worm eaten slut.
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
You cannot pay Tuesday for a blowjob today.

So, into his saddle Clint dejectedly sank.
He sat on his horse and he started to wank.
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
I cannot pay Tuesday for a blowjob today.

The Gay Caballero, his name was Latrell,
Rode up with a song that made Clint's member swell:
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
You can pay me on Tuesday for a blowjob today.

For the Gay Caballero, ol' Clint was no match;
They found him sucked dry in a tumbleweed patch.
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
Well, the Gay Caballero won't get paid on Tuesday.

The moral is clear if you're looking for it:
A blowjob on credit is worthless as shit.
Key yi yi, yippie yai yai, key yai yai yippie ay,
That's "Clint Meets the Gay Caballero," ole!
