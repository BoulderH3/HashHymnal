Title: Last Night I Stayed At Home And Masturbated

Last night I stayed at home and masturbated,
It felt so good, I knew it would.
Last night I stayed at home and masturbated,
It felt so nice, I did it twice.

You should have seen me on the long strokes,
Straight up and down, straight up and down, straight up and down.
You should have seen me on the short strokes,
Tickle the crown, tickle the crown, tickle the crown.

Smash it, bash it, beat it against the floor,
Wrap it around the bedpost, slam it in the door.
Some people thing sex is really grand,
But myself? I'd rather use my hand.
