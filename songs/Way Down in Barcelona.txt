AKA: Barcelona, Mañana
Tune: "Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me) by Peggy Lee

Way down in Barcelona, where the miners mine for coal,
A miner stuck his shovel in another miner's hole.
Said the miner to the miner: "We're here to mine for coal,"
"And not to stick a shovel in another miner's hole"

Mañana, mañana.
Mañana's good enough for me.

**Verses:**

* …the ladies learn to knit, / …stuck a needle in another lady's tit.
* …the ladies learn to swim, / …put her finger up another lady's quim.
* …the zombies decompose, / …picked a booger from another zombie's nose.
* …the wankers yank their crank, / …took a yank on another wanker's crank .
* …the hippies smoke the grass, / …stuck a reefer up another hippie's ass.
* Way up in New York City, where the cabbies drive so fast,
A cabbie rammed his cab into another cabbie's cab.
Said the cabbie to the cabbie: "FUCK YOU BUDDY!"
_(making a rolling down the window gesture, then flipping the bird)_
