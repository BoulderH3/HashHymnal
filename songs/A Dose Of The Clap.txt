Tune: He's Got the Whole World In His Hands

_(Everybody clapping along.)_

He's got a dose of the clap, on his dick.
He's got a dose of the clap, on his dick.
He's got a dose of the clap, on his dick.
And all it does is drip drip drip.

Drink it down down down, down down down.
Drink it down down down, down down down.
Drink it down down down, down down down.
Drink it down down, down down, down down down.
