Source: Descended from a Scottish bothy ballad of the same name from the 1880s (Roud Folk Song #4828)

Four-and-twenty virgins
Came down from Inverness,
And when the ball was over
There were four-and-twenty less.

**Chorus**
Singing balls to your partner,
Arse against the wall.
If you cannot get laid on a Saturday night,
Then you cannot get laid at all.

**Verses**

_(Why not replace "The village [profession] with a local hasher's name, whenever it seems fitting?)_

Four-and-twenty whores
Came up from Glockamore,
And when the ball was over
Why, their cunts were double-bore.

The bride was in her chambers
Explaining to the groom:
"The cunt, the cunt, and not the arse!
is the entrance to the womb!"

The groom was in his chambers
Explaining to the bride:
"It's the penis, not the scrotum,
That's the part that goes inside!"

The village butcher, he was there,
A great big knife in hand.
Every time he turned around,
He circumcised a man.

The village blacksmith, he was there,
His balls were made of brass.
Every time they clacked together,
Sparks shot out his ass.

The village idiot, he was there,
And what do you think of that?
He was amusing himself by abusing himself,
And catching it in his hat.

The village cripple, he was there,
He couldna get up to much.
So he leaned himself against the wall
And fucked them with his crutch.

The village blacksmith, he was there,
A big, strong man was he.
He lined them up against the wall
And fucked them three by three.

The deacon's wife, she was there,
Bent over against the wall.
Saying, "Put your money on the table, boys
'Cause I can take you all!"

The village harlot, she was there,
Swinging from the chandelier,
Dripping menstrual juices
Into everybody's beer.

The pregnant lady, she was there,
She must be almost due,
'Cause every time you stuck it in,
You got a blowjob too.

The village postman, he was there,
The poor man had the pox.
He couldna fuck the ladies,
So he fucked the letter box.

The village constable, he was there,
Pride of all the force.
They caught him in the stables,
Jerking off the horse.

Little Timmy, he was there,
He was only eight.
Too young to fuck the ladies,
He could only masturbate.

The Queen was in her chambers,
Eating bread and honey.
The King was in the chambermaid,
And she was in the money.

First lady forward,
Second lady back.
Third lady's finger,
In the fourth lady's crack.

There was fucking in the parlor,
Fucking on the stairs,
You couldna see the carpet
For the mass of pubic hairs.

When the ball was over,
The guests did all confessâ€”
The dancing it was wonderful,
But the fucking was the best!
