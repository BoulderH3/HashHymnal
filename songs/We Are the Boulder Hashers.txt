Title: We Are the Boulder Hashers
Tags: hashers, Boulder
Source: We stole and modified the Boulder Flatlander Anthem, they stole it from the Arizona Larikins Mr Happy's Pick-up Hash, who stole it from the Fort Eustice H3 (or the Flatlanders got it directly from the FEH3, depending on who you ask).  For a song that seems to get around quite a bit, people get surprisingly opinionated about it's lineage.
AKA: Boulder Hash Anthem

We are the Boulder Hashers,
And we’re glad that we are here,
We’ll out-sing your Songmeister,
We’ll drink all your beer,
We’ll fuck everybody,
Then we’ll puke in your car,
We are the Boulder Hashers,
We’re the best Hash by far!

We are the Boulder Hashers,
And we run the hills by night.
We’re up and down the alleyways,
We know the hares by sight.
We’re just a pack of randy hounds,
Who run from far to near.
We are the Boulder Hashers,
So just pass another beer.
