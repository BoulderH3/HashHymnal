Tags: verse, animal
Tune: Red River Valley

When it's hog calling time in Nebraska,
When it's hog calling time in Nebraska,
When it's hog calling time in Nebraska,
Then it's hog calling time in Nebraska.

_(This is something of a trollish song.  Mainly just volunteer a "new" verse, but repeat the first one, occasionally tossing in one of the ones below, while people lie down and pretend to take a nap, until the RA or irritated hashers cut it short.)_

* If you sing this song slowly, you're an asshole… _(Sung as slowly as possible, of course.)_
* When it's sheep fucking time in New Zealand…
* When it's cow punching time in Texas…
