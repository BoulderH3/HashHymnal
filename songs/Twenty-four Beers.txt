Some say a man's made of muscle and blood,
But a hasher's made out of shiggy and mud.
Shiggy and mud and a barrel of ale,
A half-a-mind running on a shitty trail.

You drink twenty-four beers, and what do you get?
A whole lot drunker and a little bit wet.
St. Peter don't you call me, it'll make you frown,
I can't go to heaven till I drink this down (down, down, downâ€¦)
