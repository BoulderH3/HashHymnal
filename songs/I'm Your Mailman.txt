Title: I'm Your Mailman

Tune: Bye Bye Blackbird

Here I come, down the way,
I can come twice a day.
I'm your mailman.

I don't mess with keys or locks,
I just stick it in your box.
I'm your mailman.

I can come in any kind of weather,
Because my mail sack is made of leather.

If you've got a postage stamp,
Let me lick it, make it damp.
I'm your mailman.
