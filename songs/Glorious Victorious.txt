Title: Glorious Victorious
Tags: verse, insult, location
AKA: There Are No Serious Hashers
Tune: Verses roughly to "She'll Be Comin Round the Mountain", chorus is from (and to the tune) of a traditional drinking song "Drunk Last Night" / "One More Drink" / etc.

**Chorus:**
Sing glorious, victorious,
One keg of beer for the four of us.
Singing glory be to God that there are no more of us
Because one of us could drink it all alone.
Damn near.
Pass the beer
To the rear
Of the Hash House.

**Verses**
Oh there are no serious hashers in Boulder. _(In Boulder!)_
Oh there are no serious hashers in Boulder. _(In Boulder!)_
Instead of checking out the tits,
They're too busy clicking off their splits.
Oh there are no serious hashers in Boulder. _(In Boulder!)_

* …in Miami. / Because they all wear string bikinis, / And the men have tiny weenies.
* …in Minesota. / Because they'll run a mile through snow / Just to give a cow a blow.
* …in the Navy. / They're always in their bunk, / And their hands are full of spunk.
* …in the Navy. / They just fuck around in boats, / And have sex with sheep and goats.
* …in LA. / The smog blocks out the sun, / And they don't know how to run.
* …in Nevada. / Because the line is way too long / For fucking Beano's Mom.
