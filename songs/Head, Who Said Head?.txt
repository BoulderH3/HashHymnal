Title: Head, Who Said Head?
Tags: standard circle, sex

_(Sung the first time somebody accidentally or intentionally says "head" instead of "cranium". For future occurrences, just sing the last verse and cut it off there.)_

Head, who said head?
I'll take some of that.
And I did, and I liked it,
And there was much rejoicing.

And then we fucked,
We fucked for hours,
Uprooting trees, shrubs, and flours.

Like vikings,
With shields, and spears,
And horns on our head.

Head, who said head?
I'll take some of that,
Unggh!
