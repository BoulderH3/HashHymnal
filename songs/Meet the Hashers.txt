Title: Meet the Hashers

Tune: Meet the Flintstones

Hashers, meet the hashers,
We're the biggest drunks in history.
From the hash of [Boulder],
We're the leaders in debauchery.
Half-minds, trailing shiggy through the years,
Watch us, as we down a lot of beers,
Down down, down down down down.
Down down down down down down, down down.
Down down down, down down.
Down down down, Down down dooown!

_(Some shout:)_ Wilma!
