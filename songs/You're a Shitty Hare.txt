You should have used more flour and chalk.
We followed your marks, but they said "You've been fucked."
It sucked, you suck.

You promised us Magic Hat,
But lost on your trail, we'd have settled for Pabst.
It sucked, you suck.

You've got to hold on to the drink that you've got.
It doesn't make a difference if it's beer or a shot.
This is for the tit [dick] checks you forgotâ€”on trail.

You're drinking a lot!
Ooo-ooh, there was no beer out there.
Ooo-ooh, you're a shitty hare.
Take some flour, and use it on trail.
Ooo-ooh, you're a shitty hare,
You're a shitty hare!
