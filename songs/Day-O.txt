Tune: Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)

_(When someone fails to remove their hat or other cranium cover before drinking a down down, they're called back in for another to this tune.)_

Day-O, I said day-o.
RA come, and you're gonna drink beer.
Miller, Molson, Genny Lite.
RA come, and you're gonna drink beer.
Wear a hat, and you're gonna drink twice!
RA come, and you're gonna drink beer.
