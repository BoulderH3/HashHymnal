Tune: I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones
Source: By Weird Ball Yank-a-Dick, 2016

Twenty-twenty-twenty-four bottles to go, I want to be inebriated.
A case of beer, and it's got to go-o-oh, I want to be inebriated.
Just get me to the circle, put it in my hand,
Hurry, hurry, hurry, down my throat it will be slammed,
I don't care if it's bottled, I don't care if it's canned,
Oh no no no no noâ€¦

Down down down-down, a down down down-down, I wanna be inebriated.
Down down down-down, a down down down-down, I wanna be inebriated.
_(Repeat until they're done drinking.)_
