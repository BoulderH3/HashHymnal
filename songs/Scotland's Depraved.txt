Tune: Scotland the Brave

Bring me the whisky, mother,
I'm feeling frisky, mother,
Bring me a sheep to keep me warm through the night.
And when I am done with ruttin',
We'll eat our fill of mutton,
England's a bastard, but Scotland's depraved.

No, not my sister Mary,
Her legs are far to hairy,
Bring me a sheep to keep me warm through the night.
Or bring me my little brother,
He'll make a perfect lover,
England's a bastard, but Scotland's depraved.

Beat me with whips of leather,
All through the fields of heather,
Whip me most soundly lassie, and hear me rave.
Down where the stream's a winding,
Bring out the ropes for binding,
England's a bastard, but Scotland's depraved.
