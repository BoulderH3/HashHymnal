Tags: verse, sex, spinning
Tune: The Billboard March

**Chorus**

At the gangbang, yes I would,
Because a gangbang feels so good.
When I was younger, and in my prime,
I used to gangbang all the time.
But now I'm older, and turning gray,
I only gangbang twice a day.

_(Speaking, someone tells a knock-knock joke that ends in "…at the gangbang…", which leads back into everyone singing the chorus.)_

_Solo:_ Knock-knock.
_Everyone:_ Who's there?
_Solo:_ [Name]
_Everyone:_ [Name] who?
_Solo:_ [Name, doing something] at the gangbang…

_Then, there's the degenerate verses that end in everyone singing "na na na na" while spinning in place of the whole chorus, and are inevitably followed up by one of the other "na na na na" verses until people have had enough and it ends the whole song._
