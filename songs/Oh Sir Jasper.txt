Title: Oh Sir Jasper

Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic

I wear my silken nightie in the summer when it's hot.
I wear my wool pajamas in the winter when it's not.
And sometimes in the springtime, and early in the fall,
I lie beneath the lily white sheets with nothing on at all.

Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch me!
Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch me!
Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch me!
As I lie beneath the lily white sheets with nothing on at all.

Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch!—
Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch!—
Oh, Sir Jasper, do not touch!—
As I lie beneath the lily white sheets with nothing on at all.

_(Repeat, removing one more word each time, until you end with:)_

Oh!—
Oh!—
Oh!—
As I lie beneath the lily white sheets with nothing on at all.
