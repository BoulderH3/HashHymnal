Tune: Old MacDonald Had a Farm

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had _[an animal]_, E-I-E-I-O,
With a _[noise noise]_ here, and a _[noise noise]_ there,
Here a _[noise]_, there a _[noise]_, everywhere a _[noise noise]_.

_(Sing a couple verses, then end with him having a whale.  For the sound of the whale's blowhole, spit/spray a mouthful of beer into the circle.)_
