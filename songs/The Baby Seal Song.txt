Title: The Baby Seal Song
Tags: long, animal
Source: Boulder gets this song as sung by Muffet at the Boulder winter campouts, but versions appears to be widespread at hashes, in the SCA, and all over.
Tune: Some people claim their versions are sung to "That Good Old Mountain Dew".  Muffet's tune is perhaps vaguely related to that, but different?

Way up north where it is cold,
And you know there ain't no gold,
People make their living from the skins that they've sold.
Some people hate the killing,
But I find it quite fulfilling,
'Cause I hate to see a baby seal grow old.

**Chorus**
You don't bludgeon a seal just to make a meal,
You do it cause you want to hear the little fucker squeal.
You hit him in the head and you do it just for kicks,
Then you poke out his eyes with your eye poking stick.

My mother she was mean,
My father a little obscene,
I guess that must explain the way that I feel.
I know you can't believe me,
But my wife she wants to leave me,
So I guess I take it out on a baby seal.

**Chorus**

You slice em, dice em, rototill them,
Chop them up or you just plain kill them,
And make them into tiny little bales
I know it won't be long
Till the baby seals, they're all gone,
Then I'll have to start killing the fucking whales

**Chorus**

Greenpeace, they want to lock me up
For what I've done to those seals pups;
They wanna lock me up and throw me into the keel.
But mama, mama, don't you cry,
'Cause you know that when I die
I'll be coming back as a baby seal.

**Chorus**
