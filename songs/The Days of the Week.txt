_(All the lines in the verses are said by the RA, then repeated by the circle.  The chorus is a Q&A call & response.  Each day's activity is mimed each time it's mentioned.)_

Today is Monday.
Monday is a wanking day,

**Chorus**
_RA:_ Is everybody happy?
_All:_You bet your ass we are!
_(Everyone holds their vessel above their head while spinning in circles singing:)_
Do do do do do do do do,
do do do do do do do do.

Today is Tuesday.
Tuesday is a finger day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**

Today is Wednesday.
Wednesday is her favorite day, _(Point to a different harriette each time)_
Tuesday is a two finger day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**

Today is Thursday.
Thursday is a drinking day,
Wednesday is her favorite day,
Tuesday is a four finger day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**

Today is Friday.
Friday is a fucking day,
Thursday is a drinking day,
Wednesday is her favorite day,
Tuesday is a fisting day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**

Today is Saturday.
Saturday's a hashing day,
Friday is a fucking day,
Thursday is a drinking day,
Wednesday is her favorite day,
Tuesday is a two fisting day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**

Today is Sunday.
Sunday is a day of rest and quiet contemplation.
_(All together:)_ Fuck Sunday!
Saturday's a hashing day,
Friday is a fucking day,
Thursday is a drinking day,
Wednesday is her favorite day,
Tuesday is a full body day,
Monday is a wanking day,
**Chorus**
