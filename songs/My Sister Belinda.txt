My sister Belinda
She pissed out the winda'
All over my brand new sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you pissed on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."
Aye aye aye aye,
Me and my soggy sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you pissed on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."

My sister Belinda
She shat out the winda'
All over my brand new sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you shat on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."
Aye aye aye aye,
Me and my shitty sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you shat on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."

My sister Belinda,
She menstruated out the winda'
All over my brand new sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you bled on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."
Aye aye aye aye,
Me and my bloody sombrero.
I said, "You fat twat, you bled on my hat!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."

My girlfriend Maria
Gave me gonorrhea
On a trip down to Rio de Janeiro.
I said, "You fat twat, you gave me the clap!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."
Aye aye aye aye,
Me and my drippy dick-ero.
I said, "You fat twat, you gave me the clap!"
She said, "I don't fucking well care-o."
