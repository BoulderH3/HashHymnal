Title: Some Die Of Drinking Water

Some die of drinking water,
And some of drinking beer.
Some die of constipation,
And some of diarreha.

But of all the world's diseases,
There's none that can compare,
To the drip drip drip
Of the syphilitic prick
Of the Hash House Harrier

_(Mangle the pronounciation of "diarreha" and "Harrier" to rhyme with beer.)_
