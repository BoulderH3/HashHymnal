Title: Take It In Your Hand Mrs. Murphy

Take it in your hand Mrs. Murphy,
For it only weighs a quarter of a pound.
It's got hair on it's neck like a turkey,
And it spits when you shake it up and down.

_(Optional follow up verse.)_
If I had the wings of an eagle,
And the arse of a hairy baboon,
I would fly to the ends of creation,
And butt-fuck the Man in the Moon.
