Title: A Frenchman Went to the Lavatory
Tags: poop, nationality
Tune: La Marseillaise

A Frenchman went to the lavatory
To have a jolly good shit, shit, shit.
He took his coat and trousers off
So he could revel in it, it, it.
But when he reached for the paper,
He found that someone had been there before.

"Ou est le papier,
"Ou est le papier,
"Monsieur, monsieur?
"J'ai fait manure.
"Ou est le papier, 
"Monsieur, monsieur?"
