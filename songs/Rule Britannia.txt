Tune: The chorus of "Rule Britannia"

Rule Britannia, marmalade and jam.
Three Chinese cracks to the asshole,
Bam, Bam, Bam! _(Slapping your ass in time with each bam.)_

Rule Britannia, marmalade and jam.
Two Chinese cracks to the asshole,
Bam, Bam! (pause)

Rule Britannia, marmalade and jam.
One Chinese crack to the asshole,
Bam! (pause)

Rule Britannia, marmalade and jam.
No Chinese cracks to the asshole,
God Save the Queen! _(In a high pitched, silly voice.)_

_(Anyone shouting out an extra "Bam" during the pause also gets called out to the center of circle for the rest of the song and the down down.)_
