Title: There Was A Little Bird
Tags: asshole, animal

There was a little bird,
No bigger than a turd,
A-sitting on a telephone po-o-ole.

He ruffled up his neck,
And he shat about a peck,
And puckered up his little asshole.

_(Pointing around the circle with each repetition.)_
Asshole, asshole, asshole, assholeâ€¦
He puckered up his little asshole.
