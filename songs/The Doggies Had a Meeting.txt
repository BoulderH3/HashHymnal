Title: The Doggies Had a Meeting
Tags: dog, asshole, long

The doggies had a meeting,
They came from near and far,
Some came by motorcycle,
Some came by motorcar.

Each doggie had a nametag,
Each doggie signed the book,
Each doggie hung his asshole
Upon a metal hook.

One dog was not invited,
Imagine his great ire,
He ran into the crowded hall
And loudly shouted "Fire!"

The dogs all ran in panic,
They had no time to look,
Each doggie took an asshole
From another doggie's hook.

_(Slower tempo, dragging out the -oam/-one syllable)_
And that's the reason why, sir,
On land or sea or foam—,
And that's the reason why, sir,
Wherever you may roam—,
And that's the reason why, sir,
A dog will leave his bone—,

_(Fast tempo, hashers run around sniffing butts)_
To sniff another's asshole,
To see if it's his own!
