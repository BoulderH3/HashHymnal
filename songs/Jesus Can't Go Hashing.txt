Tags: verse, religion

Jesus can't go hashing because [reason],
Jesus can't go hashing because [reason],
Jesus can't go hashing because [reason],
Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus say-ay-aves!

_(In Boulder, we only sing this chorus once, so we can get through more verses.)_
Free beer for all the hashers,
Free beer for all the hashers,
Free beer for all the hashers,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves, Jesus say-ay-aves!

* …he runs like this. _(arms out, hopping)_
* …he's stuck behind a rock.
* …the motherfucker's dead.
* …he doesn't really exist.
* …the flour falls through his hands.
* …the shiggy's on his head.
* …he lays the trail in blood.
* …his dad knows all the trails.
* …his dad knows how it ends.
* …he shortcuts across the lake.
* …the beer flows out his side.
* …he turns the beer to wine.
* …he only has twelve friends.
* …the Jew won't pay five bucks.
* …Saturday is Shabbos.
* …he's busy getting nailed.
* …he's mowing my front lawn. _(Switch to the Spanish pronounciation for the rest of the verse.)_
* Jesus saves, Moses invests.
* All the harriettes love Jesus because he's hung like this.
* All the harriettes love Jesus because they know he'll come again.
* All the harriettes hate Jesus because he takes three days to rise.
* Mohammed can't go hashing because he lays the trail with bombs.
* Moses can't go hashing because it takes him forty years.
* …he's fucking Beano's mom.
* _(Someone religious, or a "stunt Christian", on their knees in prayer)_
  Jesus, we're only kidding.
* _(Jews in the circle)_
  Jesus, we're not kidding, we are Jewish.
