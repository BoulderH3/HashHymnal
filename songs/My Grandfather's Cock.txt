Tune: My Grandfather's Clock

My Grandfather's cock was too long for his pants,
And it dragged on the floor.
It was longer by half than the old man himself,
And it weighed near a hundred-weight more.

He'd a horn on the morn' of the day he was born.
It was always his joy and is pride.
But it dropped and it shrank and it never rose again
On the day the old man died.
