Tune: PFFT! You Was Gone! (from Hee Haw)

Where, where were you last time?
Why did you make us hash all alone?
You fat, lazy bastard, you were't even here,
So we fucked all the virgins and drank all the beer!

Down, down, drink it all down
Drink it all down, drink all of that beer
You fat lazy bastard, you were't even here,
So we drank all the virgins and fucked all the beer!
