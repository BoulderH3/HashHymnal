Title: The Little Brown Mouse
Tags: animals, drinking, drunk

The liquor was spilled on the barroom floor,
And the bar was closed for the night.
The little brown mouse came out of his hole,
Under the pale moon light.

He lapped up the liquor from barroom floor,
And onto his haunches he sat.
All night long you could hear him roar:
"Bring on the goddamned cat!"

Well the cat came out about half-past one,
And ate up the little brown mouse.
And the moral of this story is:
You never drink liquor on the house!

_(Alt: "Never fuck with pussy!")_
